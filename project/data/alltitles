I stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for
trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors
I thank President Bush for his service to our nation as well as the general
incorporation has shown throughout this transition
44 Americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken
Rising tides of prosperity and the Still Waters of Peace yet every
often the oath is taken amidst Gathering clouds and raging storms at these MO
America is carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of the
in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals
forebears and true to a founding documents
so it has been so it must be with this generation of Americans
that we are in the midst of a crisis is now well understood our nation
is at war against the for fetching network of violence and hatred
our enemy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility
on the part of some but also our Collective failure to make the hard choices
prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed
businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too
and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use our end
strengthen our advisors and threaten our planet
news of the end of these are the indicators of Crisis subject
Hayden statistics less measurable but no less profound is a subpoena
confidence across Atlanta nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable
and that the Next Generation must lower its sights
what I say to you that the challenges we Face are
free software download for a group of volunteers and distributed under the G
the general public license GPL programs like a recipe
also called open source software because the source code is available
everyone to study or use there are thousands of other free and open so
programs including the Firefox web browser the liberal
are Apache OpenOffice office suit
and enter a linux-based operating systems such as
Ubuntu
real serious and their money they will not be
easily or in a short span of time but no America did they will
on this day we gather
on this day We Gather because we have chosen hope over fear U Need You
purpose of a conflict over in Discord
on this day we come to Proclaim an end to the
Grievances and false promises the wrecked recriminations and worn-out Dogma
the for far too long have strangled our politics
we remain a Young Nation but in words but in the words of scripture
the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to read
our enduring Spirit to choose a better history to carry forward the process
gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation
given promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue them
pictures of happiness in reaffirming the greatness
Nation understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned
he has never been one of the shortcuts or settling for Less it has not been there
for the faint-hearted for those who prefer Leisure over work or seek
the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the Risk Takers
who is the makers of things some celebrated but more often men
women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged
12 prosperity and freedom
does the packs of Frozen packed up their few worldly possessions
control across oceans in search of a new life
they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West End of the last of the whip dance
the harder for us they fought and died
in places like Concord and Gettysburg Normandy and casein
time in time and again these men and women struggled in soccer
and worked till their hands were raw so that we might
a better life this America's bigger
than the sum of our individual ambitions
