today we're going to begin with a short quiz no no you don't need
pencil and paper just listen it's only one question ready okay
blogs Pokemon tattoos Cabbage Patch Kids pet rocks and hula hoops have
common anybody they're all stupid I now prefer
Morgan they're all thoughts correct not use another
how did you know that in other words what are the characteristics of a fat and what's the difference
the fed and a trend these are questions were going to answer
this afternoon while the main difference I think between a fade and a trend concerns time
if that is something that seems to appear suddenly it quickly becomes an oar
the popular and then disappears just as suddenly as it came
attend appears rather suddenly it also becomes very popular but it
disappear a trend can have a long-term influence on this particular Market
fads and Trends often resemble each other at first glance but a fad usually has
definite beginning and end Pokemon might be fat but I do fantasy
bank cards for children might be a trend for example
difference is that fat usually stay within one industry trash can
cross over into many Industries the hula hoop Forest Hills
has been called the greatest fan of all time
25 million  In the late night
1525 million hula hoops were sold in just for now
but one year later South had virtually stopped
the hula hoop was at all it was fun to play with but that's
now consider cell phones there were designed to be portable
but they crossed over into the worlds of fashion Wireless 
patient now even photography people buy cell phones
that's match the latest clothes fashion that use cell phones for Wallace
access to take photos with them cell phones have become a tree
ahem
is another visitor difference between fads and Trends how well Industries accept
father often promoted by smaller companies they need quick money the feds for
large companies don't accept as right away they can't afford to be wrong
if someone is a company is known as a trendsetter
and it promotes a fat its reputation will be dead damaged large companies
products in huge numbers they don't want unsold products sitting on the shelves so
wait to see if a fad become a trend then they accepted in their stores
yes
does acid have to last before it becomes a trend I mean
all this energy drinks now that used to be only as
now there is like a hundred I distill a fat exercise
it's a trend that wouldn't energy drinks big part of the exercise friend
that's an excellent question what exactly does a fat
the trend you know there people who are paid a lot of money to answer that question if they
great companies become rich and famous if they get it wrong companies go bankrupt
careers get ruined the short answer is nobody knows distinguishing between
fads and Trends is an art not a science if it were easy it would be a lot more

845 someone must have made big money off that

millions of hula hoops by the time the fight ended and maybe some of you have heard of pet
fox in the 1970s and bought a rock for a penny put it in a gift box and Ma
did it as a pet he became an instant millionaire but the problem
the trouble with that is no one can predict them this man has no
that's only people would buy rocks as pets he started as kind of a joke
the Pokemon Creators had no idea that their cars would become instantly popular all over the
that's the thing that so mysterious about the creators and to the public
distinguishing between fads and Trends is an art not a science if it were easy
a lot more rich people in the world yes in the back
